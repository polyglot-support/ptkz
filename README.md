# PolyTokenizer (ptkz)

PolyTokenizer (ptkz) is a dynamic, versioned, and multi-modal tokenizer designed to handle complex tokenization tasks across multiple data modalities and versions. It leverages meta-embedding vectors, GPS-style gold code signal spreading, and a consistent hash-style fallback hierarchy to provide robust, scalable, and adaptable tokenization solutions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Meta-Embeddings:** Initialize token embeddings with semantically rich meta-embedding vectors that provide a meaningful starting point across different modalities and versions.
- **GPS-Style Gold Code Spreading:** Generate orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal embeddings using gold code sequences derived from meta-embeddings, allowing for coherent coexistence of multiple modalities in the same embedding space.
- **Consistent Hash-Style Fallback:** Implement a layered fallback mechanism using consistent hashing to ensure smooth transitions between different versions and modalities, with minimal disruption and efficient embedding retrieval.
- **Cross-Modality and Version Management:** Seamlessly handle multiple data types and their versions, ensuring that all tokens coexist in a unified embedding space with structured fallbacks.
- **Real-Time Adaptation:** Support dynamic and real-time adaptation of embeddings, allowing for efficient updates and integration of new tokens, modalities, and versions.

## Components

### 1. **Meta-Embedding Manager**
   - **Function:** Handles the creation, storage, and retrieval of meta-embedding vectors.
   - **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts meta-embeddings as new data or modalities are introduced.

### 2. **Gold Code Generator**
   - **Function:** Generates GPS-style gold codes based on meta-embedding vectors for signal spreading.
   - **Modality Support:** Ensures orthogonal spreading across different modalities.

### 3. **Embedding Transformer**
   - **Function:** Combines meta-embedding vectors with their corresponding gold codes to produce final embeddings.
   - **Dynamic Fine-Tuning:** Supports real-time adjustments based on training feedback.

### 4. **Consistent Hash Ring**
   - **Function:** Organizes the embedding space into a consistent hash ring, facilitating efficient lookup and fallback mechanisms.
   - **Fallback Traversal:** Handles misses by passing requests to secondary or tertiary layers in the hierarchy.

### 5. **Unified API**
   - **Function:** Provides a high-level interface for interacting with the PolyTokenizer, abstracting the complexity of embedding management and version control.
   - **Real-Time Integration:** Supports the addition of new tokens, retrieval of embeddings, and dynamic updates.

## Installation

To install PolyTokenizer, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PolyTokenizer.git
cd PolyTokenizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here’s a basic example of how to use PolyTokenizer:

```python
from polytokenizer import PolyTokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
ptkz = PolyTokenizer()

# Add a new token
ptkz.add_token('new_token', modality='text', version='v1')

# Retrieve an embedding
embedding = ptkz.get_embedding('new_token')

# Add a new modality
ptkz.add_modality('image')

# Fine-tune embeddings based on new data
ptkz.fine_tune_embeddings(new_data)
```
